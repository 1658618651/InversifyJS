# Ecosystem
InversifyJS is a tiny library, but its contracts and APIs are carefully chosen to spawn an ecosystem of tools and extensions.

On this page we will only feature a few of them that the InversifyJS maintainers have vetted personally. 
Don’t let this discourage you from trying the rest of them!
Consider these the “staff picks”, and don’t hesitate to submit a PR if you’ve built something wonderful with InversifyJS.
